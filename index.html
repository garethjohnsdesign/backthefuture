  text: It is such an honour to support the BFI's 'Back to the Future' campaign as
    they work to revolutionise our industry and make it as inclusive, accessible and
    filled with the greatest talent from the widest possible pool in our society.
    Hopefully, with campaigns such as this, no one will ever feel the doors to our
    industry we're closed to them.

  text: Film education, in all its forms, deserves pride of place in the classroom
    and beyond. What other medium has the same potential as the moving image to inspire
    minds and ignite passions? If we are to truly back the future, we must have faith
    in the power of film, both in and of itself and as a tool for teaching all manner
    of subjects.

  text: Working in film is an incredible privilege. Every corner of our industry is
    filled with talented people doing a staggering variety of things, each with a
    common goal. Still, though, this world can be opaque to those seeking to enter
    it. Through the BFI, young people with a passion for film are given the tools
    they need to succeed and get ahead in an industry that can all too often seem
    dauntingly inaccessible. These initiatives need both our celebration and our support.

  text: When I first came to the BFI I very rarely went to the cinema, now I go 2/3
    times a week. It was an absolute shock to be so immersed in incredible films,
    most of which I'd never seen before. The films I see at the BFI just further pushes
    me towards my dream of creating films that can resonate with people.

  text: Ultimately, what is film for but education? Every time you sit down to watch
    something, whatever it may be, you're learning - not just about the world around
    you, but about yourself. The BFI sees moving image as a wonderful tool for self-expression,
    and through it, people learn to engage with film in so many amazing ways. Without
    their efforts, the landscape of our industry would be much more barren.

  text: The moving image is one of the mainstays of our world's culture.  Over the
    past century it has entertained, informed and changed us.  Watching and learning
    from films and television is a sometimes joyful but always enriching experience,
    and it is an experience that should be available to everyone.  Education programmes
    at the BFI inspire the minds that will shape the future of film and, needless
    to say, it is our duty to make sure these initiatives are a success.

  text: Think of all the films yet to be that will change our lives, change our children's
    lives, shape who we are and who we can become. That can only happen if we support
    and encourage the film-makers of our future. The more we can do that now, the
    richer and more meaningful all our futures can become.

    Back the Future’ is a vital new BFI initiative that aims to educate and nurture tomorrow’s film makers. If we are to build tomorrow's accessible and diverse film community, it's vital that we find and encourage new talent from all backgrounds and in every part of our country, and give them the best possible platform from which to tell their stories. These film makers of the future will help guide us in the years ahead, telling us stories of who we were, are and are to become.
    There is no more important task…

  text: The BFI opens the door to film for young people in such a noble way. The BFI
    doesn't offer young people unlimited funding, nor perfect career paths designed
    to set us up for life. It does something which I think is much more valuable.
    It creates networks, it supports, and most importantly, it inspires. The work
    the BFI does for young people everywhere can be quite subtle, but it's so right.
    Lots of what I've gained from the BFI has happened in the background and so only
    in looking back can I see just how crucial it has been for me. I wouldn't be where
    I'm at now if it wasn't for this work the BFI does.
