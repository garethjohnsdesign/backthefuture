  text: It is such an honour to support the BFI's 'Back to the Future' campaign as
    they work to revolutionise our industry and make it as inclusive, accessible and
    filled with the greatest talent from the widest possible pool in our society.
    Hopefully, with campaigns such as this, no one will ever feel the doors to our
    industry we're closed to them.

  text: Film education, in all its forms, deserves pride of place in the classroom
    and beyond. What other medium has the same potential as the moving image to inspire
    minds and ignite passions? If we are to truly back the future, we must have faith
    in the power of film, both in and of itself and as a tool for teaching all manner
    of subjects.
