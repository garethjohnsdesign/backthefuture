                    <h2>Sam Jones, BFI Film Academy</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p class="blockquote-content">The BFI opens the door to film for young people in such a noble way. The BFI doesn't offer young people unlimited funding, nor perfect career paths designed to set us up for life. It does something which I think is much more valuable. It creates networks, it supports, and most importantly, it inspires. The work the BFI does for young people everywhere can be quite subtle, but it's so right. Lots of what I've gained from the BFI has happened in the background and so only in looking back can I see just how crucial it has been for me. I wouldn't be where I'm at now if it wasn't for this work the BFI does.</p>
